These initiatives may include, research and development: investing in research programmes to enhance crop varieties, improve farming techniques and develop innovative solutions that address agricultural challenges,&#8221;</em> Musa said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He further clarified that requesting a large sum of the fuel subsidy savings to agriculture does not mean abandoning other concerns. Instead, he believes that funding the sector will eventually benefit the entire nation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;We believe that this decision will contribute significantly to the realisation of our agricultural potential, food security, rural development, and economic diversification,&#8221;</em> he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How much is Nigeria&#8217;s savings on fuel subsidy?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a statement by Mele Kyari, the Group Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC), the country was paying about <a href=\"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/582724-fuel-subsidy-now-above-n400bn-monthly-nnpcl.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">₦400 billion</a> per month for fuel subsidy by 2022. Another report says that Nigeria spent almost <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/nigerias-nnpc-spent-10-billion-fuel-subsidy-2022-2023-01-20/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">$10 billion </a>on fuel subsidy for the entire 2022. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The amount that the government will save on fuel subsidy is between between <a href=\"https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/04/fuel-subsidy-removalll-save-economy-n3trn-annually-lcci/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">₦3 trillion</a> and over ₦4.3 trillion in 2023. Injecting a large portion of this into financing the country&#8217;s agricultural sector will no doubt go a long way. President Tinubu&#8217;s <a href=\"https://thejunction.ng/2023/05/28/tinubu-renewed-hope-nigeria-agriculture/\">Renewed Hope for Agriculture</a> plan could also use enormous funding to take off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, the government has not revealed its plan for the fuel subsidy savings. </p>\n<button class=\"simplefavorite-button\" data-postid=\"1384\" data-siteid=\"1\" data-groupid=\"1\" data-favoritecount=\"0\" style=\"\">Favorite <i class=\"sf-icon-star-empty\"></i></button>",

They propose a four-party meeting involving Iraq and Jordan</em></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Syria&#8217;s Minister of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform, Eng. Muhammad Hassan Qatana, and Lebanon&#8217;s Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Abbas Hajj Hassan, met on Monday in Beirut to discuss <a href=\"https://thejunction.ng/2023/04/28/what-is-the-state-of-food-insecurity-in-nigeria/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">food security</a> as it affects Arab nations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://syriatimes.sy/minister-of-agriculture-the-agricultural-sector-is-key-to-arab-integration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report</a> coming out of Syria, the two government officials were on the same page regarding how to proceed. They want to unify their border procedures to solve foodstuffs exchange problems. Unifying their border procedures could including lifting customs duties on affected items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, they also need Iraq and Jordan to get on board with the plan. Qatana called for a four-party meeting between the ministers of agriculture in the four countries as well as transportation officials. The Syrian minister foresees transportation hurdles that may require expert solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hassan agreed with the quartet proposal and believes that the Syria-Lebanon meeting could be the start of wider collaborations between Arab countries at the agricultural level. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Syria-Lebanon border has been historically sketchy and not precisely fixed. This problem has persisted for a long time, even after <a href=\"https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/sc8723.doc.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">mediation from the United Nations Security Council</a>. Also, <a href=\"https://www.aiswest.com/uploaded/2018_Summer_Work/History/Syrian_Intervention_in_Lebanon_1975-76_A_failure_of_strategy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">civil wars </a>in each country spills into the other and affects the border time and time again. Syria shares common borders with Iraq and Jordan, which makes the quartet meeting suggestion sensible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>State of food insecurity in Lebanon and Syria </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The World Food Programme (WFP) said that <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/countries/lebanon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">46%</a> of people in Lebanon face food insecurity and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) blames this on <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/publications/card/en/c/CB4203EN/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lack of long-term planning</a> and investment in sustainable agricultural practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Syria is not doing any better as Relief Web (RW) claims that about <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/syrian-arab-republic/11-years-conflict-syria-threat-hunger-has-never-been-higher\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">60% </a>of the country&#8217;s population suffer from food insecurity because of its civil conflict. A European Commission report says that <a href=\"https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/news-stories/stories/syria-life-time-food-insecurity_en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Syria ranks number six </a>among countries with the highest food insecurity in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, both countries are in dire need of a solution to solve its food problem. The meeting is a first step and Syria&#8217;s Qatana is pushing for a memorandum of understanding (MoU) as soon as the four countries meet to establish executive frameworks for trade exchanges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iraq fares a bit better than both countries, although it has a poverty rate of about 31.7%, only <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/countries/iraq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">6.15%</a> of its population is in dire need of food and livelihood assistance. Jordan is also relatively food secure with about <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/CB2539EN\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">15%</a> households showing a poor or borderline Food Consumption Score (FCS). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it may take a bit more convincing to get the duo on board with the border unification plan.</p>\n<button class=\"simplefavorite-button\" data-postid=\"1378\" data-siteid=\"1\" data-groupid=\"1\" data-favoritecount=\"0\" style=\"\">Favorite <i class=\"sf-icon-star-empty\"></i></button>",

T</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ethiopia Forestry Development (EFD) says that the country has 902,000 hectares of land ready for planting tree seedlings during the rainy season. The country&#8217;s<a href=\"https://climateknowledgeportal.worldbank.org/country/ethiopia/climate-data-historical#:~:text=The%20primary%20rainy%20season%2C%20Kiremt,occurs%20from%20February%20to%20May.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> main rainy season</a> occurs between mid-June and mid-September, and it is likely the one that the institution is referring to with the announcement. Although, it has a shorter one which occurs between February and May.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/top-stories/over-900-000-hectares-of-land-readied-for-planting-tree-seedlings-this-ethiopian-rainy-season/ar-AA1c5ReU\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report</a>, this is part of Ethiopia&#8217;s Green Legacy Initiative (GLI), which has planted 25 billion seedlings in the past four years. The prepared land will receive between 6.5 billion and 7 billion seedlings, Deputy Director General (DDG) Motuma Tolera of EFD told reporters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tolera adds that the country is taking tree plantation seriously because it will determine its survival in years to come as global climate situation deteriorates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;The Green Legacy Initiative is not a matter of choice as most of our mountain areas are being severely degraded. Recent studies show that millions of hectares of land are also going to deteriorate unless they are quickly covered with trees. There is a lot of soil erosion.&#8221; </em>he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While readying the land, Tolera said that the instituation studied seedlings and conducted researches to determine what kind saplings the soil and environment needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The country&#8217;s rain-fed agriculture, tourism, and forestry are part of its <a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/partnerships/green-legacy-initiative\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">key economic sectors</a>. However, these sectors are climate change sensitive and growing them leaves the country vulnerable. It is why it commenced the GLI policy and the EFD DDG has praised public participation in the initiative too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One benefit arising from the GLI is the fact that it has created more than 767,000 jobs for mostly women and youth within its more than four years of existence. The initiative includes agroforestry, forest sector development, greening and renewal of urban areas, and integrated water and soil resources management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, it has not shifted focus from its plan to become self-sufficient in some areas, like <a href=\"https://thejunction.ng/2023/05/15/ethiopia-to-scrap-sugar-imports-within-5-years/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sugar production</a>.</p>\n<button class=\"simplefavorite-button\" data-postid=\"1374\" data-siteid=\"1\" data-groupid=\"1\" data-favoritecount=\"0\" style=\"\">Favorite <i class=\"sf-icon-star-empty\"></i></button>",

        "rendered": "\n<p><strong><em>News in brief: Delta state governor Sheriff Oborevwori plans to improve the agricultural value chain as part of his</em></strong> <strong><em>administration&#8217;s agenda, focusing on sustainable growth, job creation, and infrastructure development. He aims to accelerate the construction of agro-industrial parks to enhance agricultural activities, generate employment, and improve food security in the state.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sheriff Oborevwori, the new governor of Delta state, has said that he will focus on improving the state&#8217;s agricultural sector value chain. While giving his inaugural speech, he mentioned that the sector is part of his MORE agenda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agenda, which is an acronym for Meaningful development; Opportunities for all; Realistic reforms; and Enhanced peace and security; picks up from the former governor&#8217;s groundworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He says that his plans include fostering sustainable growth and creating jobs through the private sector. It also focuses on boosting human capita and building an enabling infrastructure. Then, there is a need to enhance governance and accountability systems to improve service delivery as well as strengthening public financial management.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these objectives are what Oborevwori sets out to do during his administration.<em> &#8220;We shall develop the agricultural value chain, which is a major driver of sustainable economic growth,&#8221;</em> he told citizens of Delta state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Nigeria&#8217;s agric sector suffers from <a href=\"https://thejunction.ng/2023/04/19/how-effective-is-agro-financing-in-nigeria/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">several problems</a>, developing its value chain can solve many of these issues. Although Oborevwori does not address the amount of work that will go into improving the state&#8217;s agricultural value chain, some of his other plans directly impact it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, we mentioned earlier that the governor wants to strengthen the public financial management. If his plan works, providing subsidies and other financial aid to farmers and entrepreneurs can further improve the processes of getting inputs and processing produce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, he mentioned completing ongoing projects like road and bridges. Without a doubt, these infrastructures impact all sectors including agriculture. Then, he adds maintaining peace in the state, which will encourage new investments from the private sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The governor promises to accelerate construction of agro-industrial parks. He says that they have potential to generate employment opportunities, create wealth, reduce unemployment, and improve food security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These parks are special areas or zones designed to facilitate the integration of agricultural activities with industrial and agribusiness operations. Their aim is to create a favorable environment for agricultural production, processing, and related industries to coexist and collaborate in a coordinated manner. All of these are value chain activities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state grows most of the staple foods consumed in the country, like cassava, yam, maize, cocoyam, plantain and banana. So, it makes sense that processing these instead of shipping them out raw will increase their value. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will keep up with Governor Sheriff Oborevwori agricultural initiatives in Delta State and measure them against his inaugural promise. <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/ift-DD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Subscribe</a> to be the first to hear about it.</p>\n<button class=\"simplefavorite-button\" data-postid=\"1365\" data-siteid=\"1\" data-groupid=\"1\" data-favoritecount=\"0\" style=\"\">Favorite <i class=\"sf-icon-star-empty\"></i></button>",

The move has sparked debate, with some suggesting it aims to create a beef shortage or promote non-animal protein consumption.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Responding to a post about Ireland planning to kill 200,000 cows in its fight against climate change, tech billionaire Elon Musk has spoken out against the plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original post was from Twitter user Ashley St. Clair, who works with the conservative Christian satire news publishers,<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm12218633/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Babylon Bee</a>. Clair had said that the move was part of a push to end life of both animals and humans in the name of climate activism. A push she tagged evil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, the Tesla CEO said:</p>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This really needs to stop. Killing some cows doesn’t matter for climate change.</p>\n<p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1665094880165769216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 3, 2023</a></p></blockquote>\n<p> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Days before this incident, the Ireland Department for Agriculture refuted the claim that culling 200,000 cows was a policy. Instead, it <a href=\"https://www.irishmirror.ie/news/irish-news/department-agriculture-responds-says-report-30128058\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said</a> that part of ongoing discussions about meeting its climate change target for the next three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;The Paper referred to was part of a deliberative process – it is one of a number of modelling documents considered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and is not a final policy decision. As part of the normal work of Government Departments, various options for policy implementation are regularly considered,&#8221;</em> its statement read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Farming Independent, which broke the news, also confirmed that its source was an internal document it obtained through a freedom of information request. Clair&#8217;s <a href=\"https://cowboystatedaily.com/2023/06/02/to-fight-climate-change-ireland-may-slaughter-200-000-cows-are-us-herds-next/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">source</a> published the news two days after the department debunked the claim that it was a policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cows responsible for bulk of Ireland Methane emission</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), <a href=\"https://www.epa.ie/our-services/monitoring--assessment/climate-change/ghg/summary-by-gas/#:~:text=Methane,16%2C138.04%20kt%20CO2%20equivalent.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">methane</a> is the second highest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in Ireland. The agency says that agricultural activities account for more than 93% of the methane in the country. It also added that between 1990 and 1998, methane emissions reached its peak as livestock numbers increased. Meanwhile, it dropped between 1998 and 2011 when the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) cut down livestock numbers.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"696\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/thejunction.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/methane-1.jpg?resize=696%2C383&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"chart showing methane emissions by sector in Ireland from 1990 to 2021\" class=\"wp-image-1362\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thejunction.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/methane-1.jpg?w=706&amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/thejunction.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/methane-1.jpg?resize=300%2C165&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thejunction.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/methane-1.jpg?resize=150%2C82&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/thejunction.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/methane-1.jpg?resize=696%2C383&amp;ssl=1 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Cows produce methane as part of their food digestion process and emit it through belching.

He acknowledges that addressing the security issue is crucial for attracting investments</em></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyacinth Alia, the new Benue state governor, has promised that his administration will industrialise the state&#8217;s economy through agriculture and rural development. He mentions that the industrialisation will be led by private sector participation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, he acknowledges that he needs to fix the security issue to  &#8216;create the conditions&#8217; that will encourage investments in the state. <em>&#8220;One of the most pressing issues facing our state today is insecurity. We cannot achieve any meaningful development in an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty,&#8221;</em> a portion of his inaugural address read. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benue state has been in the terror grip of insecurity for years. In a 2022 <a href=\"https://www.thisdaylive.com/index.php/2022/09/01/21-lgas-in-benue-overwhelmed-by-insecurity-crises-says-vsf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report</a>, Victims Support Fund (VSF) chairperson, Toyosi Ogunsinji Akerele, said that crises had overrun 21 of the 23 local government areas (LGAs) of the state. Another <a href=\"https://www.icirnigeria.org/insecurity-over-40-schools-remain-closed-in-benue-communities/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">source</a> said that the state shut down more than 40 primary and secondary schools because of insecurity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benue State Emergency and Management Agency said that armed herders killed about <a href=\"https://www.icirnigeria.org/fg-frustrating-effort-to-fight-insecurity-benue-govt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">5,138</a> people between 2015 and 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alia has promised to ensure safety and address root causes of insecurity, which he claims are poverty, unemployment, and social exclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He adds that he will review and possibly reform the anti-open grazing law, which prohibits movement of cattle by herders in public places in the state to curb incidents of clashes between herders and farmers. Although, the former governor also <a href=\"https://punchng.com/benue-anti-open-grazing-law-still-in-force-ortom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">temporarily suspended the law </a>a month before handing over power.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Governor Hyacinth Alia agriculture plans require total infrastructure revamp</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>His pledge to industrialise agriculture will also no doubt include developing infrastructure, increasing mechanisation adoption, providing financing, encouraging research, training and capacity building, sharing information through extension services, market linkage, policy support, and so much more. It will be encouraging when we start seeing the governor making these essential moves, otherwise, his promises may just as well be words on paper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He appears to hang the <a href=\"https://thejunction.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Young-People-Agriculture-Featured-Image.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">financing</a> aspect of his plans on private sector-led investments. So, it will make his insecurity moves a priority and launchpad for his industrialisation plans. He adds fixing up the Benue Microfinance Bank and turning it into a &#8216;microcredit delivery&#8217; to help with financing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The governor also mentions that his predecessor did not fund the parastatals and extra-ministerial departments to deliver their services, which led to depleted infrastructure and devastating annual <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/nigeria/stories/helping-benue-children-survive-devastating-floods\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">flooding incidents</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;In view of this uncanny state of affairs, Government would immediately set in motion, machinery for clearing blocked drainage systems in Makurdi metropolis to address avoidable flooding, pending when a comprehensive solution would be found to the perennial flooding of the state capital,&#8221; </em>Alia said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The state&#8217;s flooding predicament has been a major <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=benue+state+flood+farm&amp;rlz=1C1CHBD_enNG1056NG1056&amp;ei=Bdp5ZN7PEsmfgQaononoDQ&amp;ved=0ahUKEwie5u33xKT_AhXJT8AKHShPAt0Q4dUDCA8&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=benue+state+flood+farm&amp;gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIFCCEQoAEyBQghEKABOgkIABAIEB4QsAM6BQgAEIAEOgUILhCABDoGCAAQFhAeOggIABCKBRCGAzoICAAQCBAeEA06CAghEBYQHhAdSgQIQRgBUO8IWMAxYOIzaAJwAHgAgAGFAogBlxOSAQYwLjEuMTCYAQCgAQHAAQHIAQE&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">cause of sorrow for farmers</a>. For a state nicknamed &#8216;food basket of the nation&#8217; because of its role in the country&#8217;s nutrition, its flooding has hindered its output in recent years. If Alia can solve this problem, the farmers will sigh in relief and be encouraged to cultivate more lands. He said that one of the first things his administration will do is engage the federal government on dredging River Benue.</p>\n<button class=\"simplefavorite-button\" data-postid=\"1300\" data-siteid=\"1\" data-groupid=\"1\" data-favoritecount=\"0\" style=\"\">Favorite <i class=\"sf-icon-star-empty\"></i></button>",

The loan aims to address agricultural financing challenges and contribute to Nigeria&#8217;s food production and export sector</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tingo Mobile, an African Agri-fintech company, has signed off a loan of ₦3 billion to the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN). According to a <a href=\"https://nairametrics.com/2023/06/01/tingo-mobile-plc-provides-three-billion-naira-loan-facility-to-all-farmers-association-of-nigeria-afan/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report</a>, the loan will facilitate cultivation of 3,000 hectares of land for rice and wheat poduction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thejunction.ng/2023/04/19/how-effective-is-agro-financing-in-nigeria/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Agricultural financing</a> has been one of the major issues plaguing Nigeria&#8217;s agriculture sector. Many of the improvements that farmers need to make to increase production, be more precise, and so on, needs financing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, agriculture in the country recorded a lower capital importation than several other sectors including banking, shares, services, financing, production, trading, and more.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"696\" height=\"418\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/thejunction.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1.png?resize=696%2C418&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Nigeria capital importation by sector in 2022\" class=\"wp-image-987\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/thejunction.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1.png?w=752&amp;ssl=1 752w, https://i0.wp.com/thejunction.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1.png?resize=300%2C180&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/thejunction.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1.png?resize=150%2C90&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/thejunction.ng/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1.png?resize=696%2C418&amp;ssl=1 696w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: NBS.

Tingo Mobile hopes to contribute to improving Nigeria&#8217;s food production and agric export sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AFAN welcomes supervision from Tingo Mobile on its spending in a bid to make it more transparent. The association&#8217;s president, Farouk Rabiu Mudi, mentioned that the loan will go a long way in supporting extensive land cultivation in Nigeria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the fintech, the investment allows it build a long-term revenue generation system. Its CEO, Darren Mercer, says that it already has investments in infrastructure to support export business. Thus, it is likely that this loan is a backward integration move to get the produce it needs for export.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tingo Mobile&#8217;s founder, Dozy Mmobuosi, who also founded Tingo Foods, added that African farmers are important to addressing food insecurity, poverty and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The agreement has a provision for amendments as both parties foresee situations where they may need to tweak some details to accommodate changes in food production and export.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AFAN has no government or political affiliations and includes all farmers&#8217; association, cooperatives, and other agriculture and agro-allied bodies in Nigeria. It contains about <a href=\"https://www.afan.ng/about\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">56 commodity associations</a> in the country and its spread in all states of the nation means that it can deploy the loan in proper locations, although it has not revealed details on handling the fund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tingo Mobile for its part is a multinational company and a part of the Tingo Group. It is the group&#8217;s globalisation attempt and aims to grow its subscribed farmers base from 9.3 million to 32 million.</p>\n<button class=\"simplefavorite-button\" data-postid=\"1294\" data-siteid=\"1\" data-groupid=\"1\" data-favoritecount=\"0\" style=\"\">Favorite <i class=\"sf-icon-star-empty\"></i></button>",

        "rendered": "\n<p><strong><em>News in brief: Kenya Court of Appeal upholds the temporary ban on GM crops. The decision follows a legal battle between small-scale farmers and the government, with concerns about the safety of GM foods, potential impacts on indigenous seeds and foreign interests.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kenya&#8217;s Court of Appeal has upheld a temporary ban on genetically modified (GM) crops initially placed by the country&#8217;s high court in 2022. Last year, the <a href=\"https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/tea/news/east-africa/kenyan-court-stops-gmo-imports-4036516\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">court suspended government plans </a>to import and distribute the crops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other side of the latest lawsuit was the Kenyan Peasants League, a group that represents small-scale farmers. The group&#8217;s argument was that the William Ruto-led administration used unlawful means to lift an initial <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/kenya-lifts-ban-on-genetically-modified-foods-despite-strong-opposition-104170\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">10-year ban on GM crops</a>, including not engaging the public in the decision as the constitution demanded. They simply wanted the ban reinstated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial ban was put in place in 2012 by the country&#8217;s cabinet. However, the basis for the ban is a <a href=\"https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2018/06/08/infamous-seralini-gmo-rat-tumor-study-debunked-by-european-scientists/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">debunked study</a> by Gilles-Eric Séralini linking GM foods to cancer in rats. The research publisher also<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2013.14268\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> retracted the study</a> a year later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the controversial background, the ban has remained in place until Ruto&#8217;s attempt. The farmers&#8217; lobby group claim that GM foods put consumers at risk, especially those with low incomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kenya Appeal Court&#8217;s ruling means that future genetically modified crops activities in Kenya will depend on the High Court decision. As a <a href=\"https://www.theafricareport.com/311115/blow-to-kenya-us-negotiations-on-gmo-crops-as-court-of-appeal-upholds-ban/\">coverage</a> by <em>The Africa Report </em>shows, there are political undertones to the matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the founder of Grow Biointensive Agriculture Center of Kenya (G-BIACK), Samwel Nderitu, complained that introducing GM crops will &#8216;kill&#8217; indigenous seeds while benefitting foreign companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, President William Ruto argues that the crops are the way out of <a href=\"https://thejunction.ng/2023/04/28/what-is-the-state-of-food-insecurity-in-nigeria/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">food insecurity</a> which plagues more than 4 million citizens. Also, with the country experiencing drought, he believes that genetically modified crops will stand a better chance of surviving the soil condition. He dismissed health concerns about them by citing countries like US and South Africa where the citizens consume GM foods and are doing well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to note that the GM crops are part of a US-Kenya bilateral trade plan.</p>\n<button class=\"simplefavorite-button\" data-postid=\"1288\" data-siteid=\"1\" data-groupid=\"1\" data-favoritecount=\"0\" style=\"\">Favorite <i class=\"sf-icon-star-empty\"></i></button>",

        "rendered": "\n<p><strong><em>News in brief: Bandits in Kaduna State demand a ₦10 million fine from farmers, preventing them from returning to their farms, posing a threat to food production and causing unemployment concerns.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bandits have asked farmers in Birnin-Gwari local government area of Kaduna State to pay a fine of <a href=\"https://leadership.ng/bandits-impose-n10m-levy-on-kaduna-farmers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">₦10 million</a> to be able to return to their farms. For the farmers, it is either they pay or they forget about farming for the rest of the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Mr Ishaq Usman Kasai, the chairman of the Birnin-Gwari Emirate Progressive Union (BEPU), the farmers had three days (until 30 May 2023) to pay the tax. Kasai was appealing to Nigeria&#8217;s new president, <a href=\"https://thejunction.ng/2023/05/30/tinubu-agricultural-hubs-nigeria/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bola Ahmed Tinubu</a>, to lend a hand in solving the state&#8217;s insecurity issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Kaduna farmers are no strangers to bandits violence</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The bandits threaten to attack farmers in their farms if they fail to pay. This is no empty threat as the union chief mentioned several insecurity incidents in the state within May 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;Even today, as I am writing this congratulatory message, the community is on the other hand at grief because even last Sunday night, Dadin Kowa village was attacked and sacked by bandits on motorcycles wielding different kinds of rifles,&#8221; </em>Kasai said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2023, Kaduna State commissioner for internal security and home affairs, Samuel Aruwan, <a href=\"https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nwest/594317-terrorism-1052-killed-4227-abducted-648-injured-in-kaduna-in-2022.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reported</a> that about 1,052 people died in the state in 2022. He adds that bandits abducted 4,227 and injured 648 during the period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, bandits have the state in there grasp. Also, the levy is not a one-time thing. We found a <a href=\"https://dailypost.ng/2022/09/30/farming-season-bandits-levy-n12m-on-birnin-gwari-farmers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report</a> of similar tax of ₦12 million in September 2022, asking four communities of the state — Kwaga, Kwanan-Shehu, Unguwan Liman and Unguwan Shekarau — to pay ₦3 million each. Similarly, another <a href=\"https://tribuneonlineng.com/we-paid-bandits-n400m-to-allow-us-farm-in-birnin-gwari-%E2%80%95-community-leader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report</a> pegs the total sum of levies paid to bandits between 2019 and 2022 in the Birni-Gwari Local Government to be between ₦300 million to ₦400 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, the levies come in three tranches: pre-season, mid-season, and harvest, according to a <a href=\"https://tribuneonlineng.com/we-paid-bandits-n400m-to-allow-us-farm-in-birnin-gwari-%E2%80%95-community-leader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">statement</a> by the former Managing Director of Kaduna State Media Corporation. The bandits also demand tithe-like payments from the farmers that can be as high as two percent of their produce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kaduna state is a major agricultural area with about <a href=\"https://kdbs.ng/app/uploads/2018/02/KASS-STRUCTURE-SURVEY.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1.3 million</a> farming families, at least in 2017. Its major crops include tomatoes, maize, rice and soybeans, which are all essential to nutrition in Nigeria. The state is responsible for 22% of maize in the country and 10% of groundnuts. Without access to farms, <a href=\"https://tribuneonlineng.com/we-paid-bandits-n400m-to-allow-us-farm-in-birnin-gwari-%E2%80%95-community-leader/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">industry analysts</a> have voiced concerns about a national food crisis. Not to forget, since the agric sector employs a bulk of the state&#8217;s workforce (about <a href=\"https://kdbs.ng/app/uploads/2018/02/KASS-STRUCTURE-SURVEY.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">42.4%</a>), it means that many people will be out of work if the situation persists unchecked.</p>\n<button class=\"simplefavorite-button\" data-postid=\"1282\" data-siteid=\"1\" data-groupid=\"1\" data-favoritecount=\"0\" style=\"\">Favorite <i class=\"sf-icon-star-empty\"></i></button>",

During his inaugural address on 29 May 2023, he highlighted several pain points of the citizens that his administration will focus on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key areas was the agricultural sector, which is becoming  a popular topic among Nigerian politicians. However, as this <a href=\"https://thejunction.ng/2023/05/28/tinubu-renewed-hope-nigeria-agriculture/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">article</a> as shown, these plans require deliberate efforts to come to fruition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For his part, Otti mentions that the global supply chain disruption caused by Russian and Ukraine&#8217;s conflict provides an opportunity for his state. <em>&#8220;In the interconnected world, we can occupy a crucial niche in the disrupted global supply chain. We can quickly position ourselves as the<strong> alternative production and service hub</strong> for both the West and Asia,&#8221;</em> he said. With abundant fertile lands, Abia state can easily provide agricultural products like palm oil, cocoa, and crops for international trade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, making great strides in the sector requires boosting the state&#8217; business environment to make it more welcoming and repairing infrastructure. Also, the governor will have to look into mordernising farming techniques and equipment, as well as providing high-quality inputs like fertilisers and seedlings. Irrigation facilities, extension services, and access to credit are also essential.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Creating 300,000 jobs and infrastructural makeover in Abia state</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the latter, Otti said that his government will partner with commercial banks, local and international development agencies, venture capitalists and independent investors to provide a<strong> ₦10 billion</strong> funding for 20,000 micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in agriculture and other &#8216;high impact areas&#8217; like ICT, small-scale manufacturing, fashion, and leatherworks. The governor hopes that these businesses can provide <strong>300,000</strong> direct and indirect jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, he mentioned that the reforms in the power sector gives the state an opportunity to provide steady electricity access to entrepreneurs in the agro industry and others. <em>&#8220;Our administration shall also make sure that the major obstacles to business success such as poor road networks, over-taxation and restricted access to local and global markets are timeously dealt with,&#8221; </em>Otti further said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Abia state&#8217;s new governor wants his state to occupy a position in the top 5 ranking of the &#8220;Ease of Doing Business&#8221; index in Nigeria. He will encourage &#8216;genuine public private sector collaboration&#8217; to help actualise this dream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Dr Alex Otti has said that he will establish an Ombudsman office to handle complaints and a special Unit to drive project implementation, we will also keep track of his promises as it relates to agriculture in Abia state and you can have a front row seat to these updates by <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/ift-DD\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">subscribing to our newsletter</a>.</p>\n<button class=\"simplefavorite-button\" data-postid=\"1273\" data-siteid=\"1\" data-groupid=\"1\" data-favoritecount=\"0\" style=\"\">Favorite <i class=\"sf-icon-star-empty\"></i></button>",
